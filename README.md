# Gartic-Phone-Draw-Bot
Drawing Bot for Gartic Phone
The code if very messy, especially the function for line drawing. Kinda just winged it and hoped it worked.
If at any time the program won't start clicking or clicks randomly just press esc to kill the program

(Thanks to ToastCart for his feedback!)
Instructions:
Run GetColorPositions.exe and click set color positions. Click the black color, then the gray color, the the white color (below the black). Click test color positions and see if all the colors match up. If they don't, then try again. Finally, click save color positions.

Open DrawBot.exe and either paste in an image you want drawn or select a local file. Then Click set drawing boundary to set where the image should be drawn and finally click Draw!
